Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why Bash?
+++++++++
Python doesn't execute the code directly for no other reason than it's much
easier to debug the shell script that is being executed on the host itself.

Is there any support for docker/build images?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Currently there is none, but it's planned. Contributions are welcome.
